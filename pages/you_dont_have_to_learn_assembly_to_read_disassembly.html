    <h1>
You don't have to learn assembly to read disassembly
    </h1>
    <p>
Reading disassembly is more like reading tracks than reading a book. You have to know the language to read a book, but reading tracks, although it gets better with skills and experience, mostly requires attentiveness and logic thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
Most of the time we read disassembly only to answer one simple question: <i>does compiler do what we expect it to do</i>? In 3 simple exercises, I’ll show you that you too can often answer this question even if you have no previous knowledge of assembly. I’ll use C++ as a source language, but what I’m trying to show is more or less universal, so it doesn’t matter if you write in C or Java, C# or Rust. If you compile to any kind of machine code — you can benefit from understanding your compiler.
    </p>
    <h2>
1. Compile time computation
    </h2>
    <p>
Any decent compiler tries to make your code efficient. This means doing as little work in runtime as possible. Sometimes it can even conduct the whole computation in compile time, so your machine code will only have to contain the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
This source code defines the number of bits in a byte and returns the size of <span class="code_piece">int</span> in bits.
    </p>
    <table><tr>
    <td style="width: 505pt;">
    <pre>
static int BITS_IN_BYTE = 8;

int main(){
    return sizeof(int)*BITS_IN_BYTE;
}
    </pre>
    </td>
    </td></tr></table>
    <p>
The compiler knows the size of an <span class="code_piece">int</span>. Let's say, for the target platform it is 4 bytes. We also set the number of bits in a byte explicitly. Since all we want is a simple multiplication, and both numbers are known in compile time, the compiler can simply compute the number instead of generating the code that computed the same number each time it's being executed.
    </p>
    <p>
Although, this is not something that is guaranteed by the standard. The compiler may or may not provide this optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
Now look at two possible disassemblies for this source code and decide what variant does compile time computation and what doesn’t.
    </p>
    <table><tr>
    <td>
    <pre>
  push    rbp
  mov     rbp, rsp
  mov     dword ptr [rbp - 4], 0
  movsxd  rax, dword ptr [BITS_IN_BYTE]
  shl     rax, 2
  mov     ecx, eax
  mov     eax, ecx
  pop     rbp
  ret</pre>
    </td>
    <td>
    <pre>
  mov     eax, 32
  ret</pre>
    </td></tr></table>
    <div id="shown_1">
        <button type="button" onclick="show(1)">The left one does</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="show(1)">The right one does</button>
    </div>
    <div id="hidden_1" style="display:none;">
        <p>
Of course, the one on the right does.
        </p>
        <p>
On 32-bit platform <span class="code_piece">int</span>'s size is 4 bytes, which is 32 bits, which is exactly the number in the code. You might not know that integer function conventionally returns output in <span class="code_piece" id="shown_eax" onclick="show('eax')"><u>eax</u></span><span style="display: none;" id="hidden_eax"><span class="code_piece">eax</span> which is a <span id="shown_register" onclick="show('register')"><u>register</u></span><span style="display: none;" id="hidden_register">register. There are quite a few registers but most important for us are the general purpose registers, more specifically <span class="code_piece">eax</span>, <span class="code_piece">ebx</span>, <span class="code_piece">ecx</span>, and <span class="code_piece">edx</span>. Their names respectively are: <b>a</b>ccumulator, <b>b</b>ase, <b>c</b>ounter and <b>d</b>ata. They are not necessary interchangeable</span>. You can think of them as ultrafast predefined variables of known <span id="shown_size" onclick="show('size')"><u>size</u></span><span id="hidden_size" style="display: none">size. For instance, <span class="code_piece">rax</span> is 64 bits long. The lower 32 bits of it is accessible by the name <span class="code_piece">eax</span>. The lower 16 bit of it as <span class="code_piece">ax</span>, which in its own turn consists of two bytes <span class="code_piece">ah</span> and <span class="code_piece">al</span>. These are all the parts of a same register</span></span>. But the thing is, the code on the right already has an answer in it, so it doesn't even matter.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>
2. Function inlining
    </h2>
    <p>
Calling a function implies some overhead by preparing input data in the particular order; then starting the execution from another piece of memory; then preparing output data; and then returning back.
    </p>
    <p>
Not that it's that ineffective but if you only want to call the function once, you don’t have to <i>actually call</i> the function. It just makes sense to copy or “inline” the function body to the place it is called from and skip all the formalities. Compilers can often do this for you so you don't even have to bother.
    </p>
    <p>
If the compiler makes such an optimization, this code:
    </p>
    <table><tr>
    <td style="width: 505pt;">
    <pre>
<i>inline</i> double <b>twice</b>(double x){
    return x + x;
}

double <b>triple</b>(double x){
    return twice(x) + x;
}
    </pre>
    </td>
    </td></tr></table>    
    <p>
Virtually becomes this:
    </p>    
    <table><tr>
    <td style="width: 505pt;">
    <pre>
<i>// not really a source code, just explaining the idea</i>
double triple(double x){ 
    return x + x + x; <i>// twice gets inlined here</i>
}
    </pre>
    </td>
    </td></tr></table> 
    <p>
But the standard does not promise that all the functions marked as <span class="code_piece">inline</span> shall get inlined. It's more a suggestion than a directive.
    </p>
    <p>
Now look at these two disassembly variants below and choose the one where the function gets inlined after all.
    </p>
    <table><tr>
    <td>
    <pre>
  movapd  xmm1, xmm0
  addsd   xmm1, xmm1
  addsd   xmm1, xmm0
  movapd  xmm0, xmm1
  ret</pre>
    </td>
    <td>
    <pre>
  push    rax
  movsd   qword ptr [rsp], xmm0
  call    twice(double)
  addsd   xmm0, qword ptr [rsp]
  pop     rax
  ret
.................................
  addsd   xmm0, xmm0
  ret</pre>
    </td></tr></table>
    <div id="shown_2">
        <button type="button" onclick="show(2)">Inlined in the left one</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="show(2)">Inlined in the right one</button>
    </div>
    <div id="hidden_2" style="display:none;">
        <p>
Not really a mystery either. It’s the one on the left. You might not know, that the instruction to call a function is really called the <span id="shown_call" onclick="show('call')"><span class="code_piece"><u>call</u></span></span><span id="hidden_call" style="display:none"><span class="code_piece">call</span>. It stores a special register that points to the next instruction after the call in the stack and then sets it to the function address. A processor hence jumps to run the function. The function then uses <span id="shown_ret"><span class="code_piece" onclick="show('ret')"><u>ret</u></span> to get</span><span id="hidden_ret" style="display:none"><span class="code_piece">ret</span> to get a stored address from the stack back to the register, and make processor jump</span> back to from where it has been called</span>. But since the disassembly on the left doesn't even contain any recall of <span class="code_piece">twice</span>, the function has to be inlined anyway.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>
3. Loop unrolling
    </h2>    
    <p>
Just like calling functions, going in loops implies some overhead. You have to increment the counter; then compare it against some number; then jump back to the loop beginning.    
    </p>
    <p>
Compilers know that in some context it is more effective to unroll the loop. It means that some piece of code will actually be repeated several times in a row instead of messing with the counter comparison and jumping here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
Let's say we have this piece of code:
    </p>
    <table><tr>
    <td style="width: 505pt;">
    <pre>
float power_of_4(float x){
    float result = 1;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; ++i)
        result *= x;
    return result;
}
    </pre>
    </td>
    </td></tr></table>
    <p>
The compiler has all the reasons to unroll such a simple loop, but it might as well choose not to. 
    </p>
    <p>
Which disassembly has the unrolled loop? 
    </p>
    <table><tr>
    <td>
    <pre>
  movaps  xmm1, xmm0
  movss   xmm0, dword ptr [rip + .LCPI0_0]
  mov     eax, 4
.LBB0_1:
  mulss   xmm0, xmm1
  add     eax, -1
  jne     .LBB0_1
  ret</pre>
    </td>
    <td>
    <pre>
  movaps  xmm1, xmm0
  mulss   xmm1, xmm1
  mulss   xmm1, xmm0
  mulss   xmm1, xmm0
  movaps  xmm0, xmm1
  ret</pre>
    </td></tr></table>
    <div id="shown_3">
        <button type="button" onclick="show(3)">Unrolled loop is on the left</button>
        <button type="button" onclick="show(3)">Unrolled loop is on the right</button>
    </div>
    <div id="hidden_3" style="display:none;">   
        <p>
It's the one on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
You might not know that <span class="code_piece">j&lt;*&gt;</span> is the family of <span id="shown_jump" onclick="show('jump');"><u>jump instructions</u></span><span id="hidden_jump" style="display:none">jump instructions. There is one unconditional jump <span class="code_piece">jmp</span>, and a bunch of conditional jumps like: <span class="code_piece">jz</span> — jump when zero; <span class="code_piece">jg</span> — jump when greater; or, like in our code, <span class="code_piece">jne</span> — jump when not equal. These react on the <span id="shown_flags" onclick="show('flags')"><u>flags</u> previously set by a processor</span><span id="hidden_flags" style="display:none">flags previously set by a processor. These are the bits residing in a special register that get triggered by arithmetic instructions such as <span class="code_piece">add</span> or <span class="code_piece">sub</span>, or by a special instruction to compare things <span class="code_piece">cmp</span></span></span>. Then again, the code on the right clearly has a repeating pattern, while the one on the left has a number four that is the loop's exit condition, and that should be enough to make a conclusion.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>
Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
You could argue that these examples were deliberately simplified. It’s only a half-truth. I did refine them to be more demonstrative, but conceptually they are all taken from my own practice.
    </p>
    <p>
Using static dispatch instead of dynamic made our image processing pipeline up to 5 times faster. Repairing broken inlining helped to win back 50% of performance for edge-to-edge distance function. And changing counter type to enable loop unrolling won us about 10% performance gain on matrix transformation, which is not much, but all it took to achieve that was simply changing <span class="code_piece">short int</span> to <span class="code_piece">size_t</span> in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
Apparently, old versions of MSVC fail to unroll loops with counters of non-native type. Who would have thought? Well, the truth is, even if you know that particular quirk, you can't possibly know every aspect of every compiler out there, so looking at disassembly once in a while might be useful.
