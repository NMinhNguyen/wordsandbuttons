All the code is properly <a href="http://unlicense.org/">unlicensed</a>. 

If you want to use some visuals for teaching (or anything else really), you can just cut them out from the code like I always do for the talks and presentations. Like this one: https://wordsandbuttons.online/KAC_2/, or that one: https://wordsandbuttons.online/MatAcademy/integer.html. 

If you need help with that, or you have an idea for the great visual you don't know how to implement, just mail me ok@wordsandbuttons.online and I'll do that for you.
