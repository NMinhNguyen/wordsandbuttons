Frequently asked questions
    </h1>
	<h2>
Who?
	</h2>
    <p>
Hello, I’m Oleksandr Kaleniuk – a Ukrainian software engineer. 
	</p>
	<p>
I have a master's in computer science and C. T. S (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_of_Sciences) in applied geometry. The last one took me five years writing the thesis, publishing papers, and speaking at local conferences. It was a slow burner and eventually, it burned my passion for academia to the ground.
	</p>
	<p>
I did all sorts of odd jobs in the  2000s. I’ve been a porter, a journalist, a bassist, a web-designer, a game designer, and a technical editor for a book on historical metrology. I’ve been programming the whole time too. One time I wrote a keylogger, no questions asked, for about 10$, and the next month someone stole my internet password with another keylogger and downloaded 8$ worth of porn. That's how I learned about both karma and marginal profit.
	</p>
	<p>
In 2012 I quit my job in game dev, quit the university, and came back to my home town in Eastern Ukraine. I’ve been planning to decompress for a while but somehow I landed on a job doing back-end in Erlang remotely for a Turkish gaming site. It was fun and new, and I learned a lot. Unfortunately, the remote work arrangement didn’t work for me. I started bringing work problems home and personal problems to work. A few days before Christmas I quit that job too.
	</p>
	<p>
I spent most of the winter frying potatoes, playing Borderlands, and watching videos from C++  conferences. Then I got hired by a nuclear power plant automation firm to do research in ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■ and ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■■■. This was an eye-opening experience. I learned that I have to relearn all the things I learned previously to call myself an engineer. Philosophy and marketing spoiled the software anywhere else, but in safety-critical engineering, you have to let the beliefs go and let the evidence take their place.
	</p>
	<p>
In 2014 the war broke out. I was still in Eastern Ukraine. My town was occupied by Russians, then luckily fought back soon before the Minsk Protocol. I was there the whole time. It was a matter of principle - terrorism only works as good as terrified you are. The next spring, however, my contract with the NPP firm ended and I decided to move on, too.
	</p>
	<p>
And that’s how I landed working for Materialise in Kyiv. SDK Core team in the Central Research and Development department to be exact. My work is to make the said SDK better. It's the job between math and low-level programming so it suits me well. 
	</p>
	<h2>
What?
	</h2>
	<p>
This is Words and Buttons Online – a growing collection of blah-blah-blah about blah-blah-blah. Ok, I admit it. It's my blog.
	</p>
	<p>
I didn't want it to be a blog though. That's why pages don't have timestamps and any authorship attribution.
	</p>
	<p>
But it wasn't truly anonymous either. It wasn't the goal. The goal always was to give the readers all the value with as little overhead as possible. I'd say, for 99% of readers the authorship of content is uninteresting and the time of publishing is irrelevant. The remaining 1% can easily get this info via GitHub. At the same time, the content of this site is vastly dictated by my own interests, my own experience, and my own mistakes, too. It would be dishonest to evade responsibility for them by going 100% anonymous.
	</p>
	<p>
So this is a blog with interactive elements and without timestamps and attribution. Kind of.
	</p>

	<h2>
Why?
	</h2>
	<p>
This thing has so many points of agenda I forgot what was supposed to be hidden. 
	</p>
	<p>
Plus, the whole thing is eclectic. It might be that the reasoning for one page isn't the same as for another.
	</p>
	<p>
One thing is absolutely clear though: this is not about business as usual. I do not collect user data, I do not show ads, and I don't do product placement. Weird enough, technically the site is profitable.
	</p>
	<p>
In general, it works like this. I learn something cool, I share it, I get feedback and I get better at what I do. This affects my rate as a contractor and gives material for the talks. And since my expenses are very low, the remuneration for the latter alone covers them with a think overlap.
	</p>
	<p>
Sometimes, I share something that has no potential for the talks. That's mostly basic math pages. I still get a bit of experience from doing them but I don't get a lot of useful feedback. I believe it's still important to do them once in a while because of how underprivileged basic math is in our society.
	</p>

	<h2>
How?
	</h2>
	<p>
Ah, that's interesting. In a way, this is an experiment in unchitecture. Every page is self-contained: JS, CSS, and HTML bundled together. There are no generators, pages' sources are pages themselves. There are no external dependencies, no frameworks, no libraries just plain JavaScript. There are no internal dependencies. If I need a piece of functionality I wrote before, I just copy and adapt what I want.
	</p>
	<p>
In terms of modern software architecture, it's a huge step back. And given how well it goes in terms of development and maintainability, I'm starting to believe that the software architecture itself is a hoax.
	</p>
	<p>
For instance, I ignore OOP completely. The sole purpose of runtime polymorphism is dependency inversion and I don't have dependencies at all.
	</p>
	<p>
I repeat myself, I adore global variables, I eval code, I never sanitize user input, and I repeat myself. 
	</p>
	<p>
There's only one rule: every page should be under 64 KB. I believe there is some threshold of complexity and it's all fine while you're below that threshold. In my case, one simple rule trumps all the best practices.
	</p>
